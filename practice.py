# In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler. Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles come in packages of 6.

# How many tiles are needed?
# You buy 17 packages of tiles containing 6 tiles each. How many tiles will be left over?

# tiles = 17 * 6
# print(tiles)

# part_one = 9 * 7
# print(part_one)

# part_two = 5 * 7
# print(part_two)

# leftover_tiles = tiles/(part_one + part_two)
# print(leftover_tiles)

# ## decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
# rainfall *= .9
# print(f"This is the rainfall variable decreased by 10% {rainfall}")

# ## add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
# reservoir_volume += rainfall
# print(f"This the reservior volume {reservoir_volume}")
# ## increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
# ## into the reservoir in the days following the storm
# reservoir_volume *= 1.05
# print(f"This is if the reservior volume increased by 5% {reservoir_volume}")
# ## decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
# reservoir_volume *= 0.95
# print(f"This is if the reservior volume decreased by 5% {reservoir_volume}")
# ## subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
# ## that's piped to arid regions.
